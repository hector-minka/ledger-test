/**
 * Implements a builder pattern that allows a more
 * convenient way to work with ledger records. This
 * class has functions that simplify construction,
 * hashing, signing, testing and sending records to
 * remote ledger instances.
 *
 * This builder is intended for sending access checks
 * to ledger, and will attempt to send it on the API
 * with the content that was prepared in the builder.
 *
 * NOTE: current access check is mutated by this
 * class, we are not cloning instances intentionally,
 * and it isn't advised to reuse builder instances when
 * working with multiple records or mutating objects
 * passed to this builder in external code. It is
 * recommended to clone objects in such cases to avoid
 * unexpected behaviors.
