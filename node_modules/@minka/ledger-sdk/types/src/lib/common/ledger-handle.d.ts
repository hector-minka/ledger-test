/**
 * Represents a ledger record identifier given by record creator.
 * Handle can consist of lowercase and uppercase letters, digits,
 * and special characters: _, -, :, ., =, $, /, +. Handle should not
 * start with `$<3 letters>.` prefix because this pattern is
 * designated for LUID. Handle type should not be used for identifiers
 * which support domains, i.e., it should not contain an @ symbol. For
 * those identifiers the LedgerAddress type should be used.
